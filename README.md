# This is my project from Coursera's [Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-native) course.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the `--no-interactive` flag.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).

#### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

**Warning:** Running eject is a **permanent** action. Please use a version control system, such as git, so you can revert back if necessary. An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) set up.
